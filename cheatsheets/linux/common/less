### useful less flags
```
Start at a specific place in the file:
  To start at a specific line number, say line 150, use "less +150 filename".
  To start where a specific pattern first appears, use "less +/pattern filename".
  To start at the end of the file, use "less +G filename".

Watch a growing file:
  Use the F command to go to the end of the file and keep displaying more text as the file grows.
  You can do this from the command line by using "less +F ...".
```
