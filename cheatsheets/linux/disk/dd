# dd converts and copies a file,
# it's commonly used to write the contents of a device file to a target block device

# replace contents of `of` (output file) with that of `if` (input file),
# work with `bs` (blocksize) amount of bytes at a time (default: 512), show status progress
# example is provided below the general syntax form
dd if=[IN_FILE] of=[OUT_FILE] bs=[BLOCKSIZE] status=progress
dd if=[ /dev/zero | /dev/urandom ] of=/dev/sdX bs=512 status=progress
