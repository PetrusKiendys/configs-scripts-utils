# Netcat (nc) is a versatile utility for working with TCP or UDP data:
#   eg. listen on ports, send data packets, act as proxy, ...

# listen continuously for a connection on port XXXX (verbose output), don't resolve hostname/port
nc -n -vv -l -k XXXX

# send tcp packet without waiting for timeout
echo "hello from [env-net-machine]" | nc -w 0 ip port
