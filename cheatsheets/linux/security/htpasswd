# Generate basic auth `user:password` pair, used for (web) HTTP authentication

# get the input password from the command line (`-b`) (UNSAFE!), output the results to stdout (`-n`)
# encrypt with bcrypt (`-B`), set compute time / encryption strength (`-C`) (default: 5; valid: 4-31; higher is more secure but slower)
htpasswd -bnBC <strength> <user> <password>
